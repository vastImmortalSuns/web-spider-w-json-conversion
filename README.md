# web-spider-w-json-conversion

This is a small-scale web scraper I made in response to a coding challenge in October of 2018. 

There are two files here: the first .py file contains the spider's code, and the second is a text file that contains the spiders code w/ my comments. These are seperate because my IDE was, for whatever reason, unable to compile my code when accompanied by all my comments.

Enjoy!
